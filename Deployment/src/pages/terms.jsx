          A Privacy Policy is a legal agreement between website owners and
          website visitors that provides visibility about how visitors’ personal
          information is collected, used, and protected. Almost every time you
          visit a website, you’re prompted to share personal information with
          that website. This could be for marketing purposes, or it could be
          essential to providing some sort of service you’re requesting. Either
          way, you’ll likely be disclosing your personal data, and a Privacy
          Policy sets out some rules to regulate this data-sharing relationship
          and protect your interests. To be specific, a Privacy Policy will
          disclose any relevant details about: Which types of information are
          being collected The purposes for which this data will be collected How
          this data will be stored, and any relevant security or access
          considerations How data will be transferred, and under which
          circumstances Who your data will potentially be shared with, and why
          The specific rights that users retain over their data How users can
          exercise the rights they retain over their data Other related policies

          user-friendly Privacy Policies has never been more important. After
          all, we all deserve to know when our personal data is used and what’s
          being done with it. A Privacy Policy is a legal agreement between
