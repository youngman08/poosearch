    <p>FIELD [0001] The present disclosure relates to the use of a blockchain in conjunction with a transaction processing network, specifically the posting of transaction message data in a blockchain verified using a transaction processing network and the verification and transmission of blockchain transaction data using a transaction processing network.
      BACKGROUND [0002] Transaction processing networks, also known as payment networks, involve significant hardware and infrastructure that are specifically configured to quickly process payment transactions from anywhere in the world using a vast, interconnected network. Transaction processing networks often operate using detailed rules and standards, to ensure accuracy, security, efficiency, and otherwise maintain order in the processing of potentially trillions of transactions every year. While such networks are often highly sophisticated, transaction processors are often constantly developing new technologies to further increase the sophistication of these networks, to provide for even more security to protect against fraud and to provide peace of mind to consumers.
      [0003] Thus, there is a need for a technical solution to further increase the security involved in the processing of payment transactions using a transaction processing network. The use of blockchains as an alternative for transaction processing has become more desirable in recent years, due to privacy and security concerns, where some consumers value the seemingly complete confidentiality and anonymity of blockchain transactions over an established, centralized processing network. The decentralized nature of a blockchain may be detrimental for a number of consumers, for example, such as due to the lack of security of digital wallets, the instability of blockchain currency, lack of processing speed, etc. However, it may be useful when used in conjunction with a transaction processing network to provide for added verification of traditionally processed transactions, and for increased performance and processing speed of blockchain transactions. Thus, there is a need for a technical solution where a payment transaction network may be used in conjunction with a blockchain network for increased processing of both types of transactions.

    <p>The present disclosure provides a description of systems and methods for validating blockchain transactions using a transaction processing network.
      [0005] 
      A method for validating blockchain transactions using a transaction processing network includes: storing, in a rules database of a processing server, a plurality of transaction rules including at least one or more authentication rules configured to authenticate an electronic transaction and one or more verification rules configured to verify a blockchain transaction; receiving, by a receiving device of the processing server, a transaction message, wherein the transaction message is associated with an electronic transaction, is formatted based on one or more standards, and includes at least a message type indicator indicative of a type of transaction and a plurality of data elements including at least one or more first data elements configured to store blockchain data and a plurality of additional data elements configured to store transaction data values; identifying, by an authentication module of the processing server, an authentication score for the electronic transaction based on application of at least one of the one or more authentication rules to the transaction data values stored in the plurality of additional data elements included in the received transaction message; identifying, by a verification module of the processing server, a verification score for the electronic transaction based on application of at least one of the one or more verification rules to the blockchain data stored in the one or more first data elements included in the received transaction message; generating, by a generation module of the processing server, a data message, wherein the data message includes at least the blockchain data stored in the one or more first data elements included in the received transaction message, the identified authentication score, and the identified verification score; and electronically transmitting, by a transmitting device of the processing server, the generated data message to a blockchain network associated with the blockchain data stored in the one or more first data elements included in the received transaction message.
