          A Privacy Policy is a legal agreement between website owners and website
          visitors that provides visibility about how visitors’ personal
          information is collected, used, and protected. Almost every time you
          visit a website, you’re prompted to share personal information with that
          website. This could be for marketing purposes, or it could be essential
          to providing some sort of service you’re requesting. Either way, you’ll
          likely be disclosing your personal data, and a Privacy Policy sets out
          some rules to regulate this data-sharing relationship and protect your
          interests. To be specific, a Privacy Policy will disclose any relevant
          details about: Which types of information are being collected The
          purposes for which this data will be collected How this data will be
          stored, and any relevant security or access considerations How data will
          be transferred, and under which circumstances Who your data will
          potentially be shared with, and why The specific rights that users
          retain over their data How users can exercise the rights they retain
          over their data Other related policies (e.g cookie policy, terms and
          conditions) It sounds confusing, we know. But that’s exactly why
          creating more readable, accessible and user-friendly Privacy Policies
          has never been more important. After all, we all deserve to know when
          our personal data is used and what’s being done with it. A Privacy
